                        This page on travel information in Kuala Lumpur includes sections that deal with minute travel details such as customs entry procedures, transport, traditional culture, and even tipping policy. Particularly important when planning a trip to the city, with the countryâ€™s multi-ethnic racial makeup it is important to come prepared so you do not unintentionally offend locals.

To help you navigate through in and outs of the city, this Kuala Lumpur travel information page will keep you updated on the latest practices, from the instant you step out of the plane to the time you check out of your hotel to depart KL.
