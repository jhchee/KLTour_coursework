                                            Ticking all the right boxes, we just cannot sing Hotel Mayas praises enough - first lets talk about its excellent location - just opposite the five-star property is super nightclub, Zouk KL, while just around the corner (a five-minute walk) is Suria KLCC.Stylish and chic, hotel amenities include a business centre with secretarial services, ballroom, six meeting rooms and five F&B venues.We especially love Sky Lounge, a bistro reserved exclusively for hotel guests, where you can enjoy complimentary drinks and snacks from 21:00 -23:00.Leisure facilities include an on-site spa (with six treatment rooms), an amazing hydrotherapy pool and a gym with scheduled yoga and Pilates classes.
